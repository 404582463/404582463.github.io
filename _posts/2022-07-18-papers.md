## common sense reasoning
physical objects, properties.affordance / temporal, numerical / human behaviours, social norms / commonsense

## Knowledge-Aware Reasoning
Symbol Space & Semantic Space
We have a schema graph for the possible answer candidates

## Schema graph (challenges)
- usually noisy and incomplete
- numerous graphs
- how to select the most related ones
- how to encode
- there is no supervision in aligning(对齐) graphs and QA pairs
- need to be compatible with neural sentence encoders

## Framework Overview

### Concept recognition
- tokenization / lemmatization
- match ConceptNet vocab
- merge multiple smaller concepts into a longer(larger) one
- **Question Concepts** C<sub>q</sub> and **Answer Concepts** C<sub>a</sub>

### Path finding
- find path between each QA-concept pair
- path pruning by length (<=5 nodes) and embedding-based metric
  - train knowledge graph embeddings for scoring paths
  - choose the highest-score relation by the KGE
